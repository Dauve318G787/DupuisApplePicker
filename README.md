## Project Description

This project is an expansion upon the Apple Picker project in the Bond book. It is a simple physics-based game in which the player is given four baskets to catch apples in. Catching an apple results in 100 points, while missing an apple results in
a basket being removed.

There are also bad apples, which are colored purple. Catching one of those results in the player's score being reset, although the game continues unabated.

A game session consists of four rounds. Rounds are incremented as game time goes on, and once round 4 is reached, the game ends. When the game ends, the player has the opportunity to restart it, and the player's high score is kept.
If four apples are missed by the player, the round count and score both get reset to zero.
